## SVG vs Canvas

<https://www.sitepoint.com/canvas-vs-svg-choosing-the-right-tool-for-the-job/>

**SVG** = visual scalability but more DOM memory.
 - good for hi-fi interactive graphics.

**Canvas** = "paint-and-forget" less DOM memory but raster instead of ability to do vector scaling.
 - good for painting detailed small pixels, like weather maps.

You can even combine SVG and canvas.
